# New Moon: Zenit

>DESIGNATION: 37-Zenit

>RISK LEVEL: A

>POPULATION:  None, save for the shadows that haunt its depths.

>Conditions: Zenit lies hidden beneath the icy surface, its underground passages carved into the frozen bedrock. The air is heavy with the chill of the depths, and the silence is punctuated only by the distant echoes of the frozen world above.

>Fauna: Within the labyrinthine tunnels, whispers of dangerous entities echo, their presence suggested by eerie disturbances and unsettling encounters reported by past explorers.

>HISTORY:Zenit Subterrane was constructed as a refuge from the inhospitable conditions of the moon's surface, a sanctuary for those seeking shelter from the icy wilderness above. Yet, as communication with the surface was lost, the bunker became a tomb, its halls haunted by the ghosts of those who once sought solace within its walls.

>ROUTING COST: 520
